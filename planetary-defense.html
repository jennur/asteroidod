              <h2>"How can we prevent an asteroid impact with Earth?"</h2><br/>
              "The first step is to deploy a more extensive asteroid observation network,
              using ground-based and space-based assets, to complete the survey of the NEO population.
              The combined efforts of space-based and ground-based observation assets are key to
              detecting and characterizing newly found NEOs.
              Equally important to initial detection are follow-up observations for precision orbit determination and physical
              characterization to determine the size and composition of the object.
              <br/>
              The key to preventing an impact is to find any potential threat as early as possible.
              With a couple of decades of warning, which would be possible for 100-meter-sized asteroids with a
              more capable detection network, several options are technically feasible for preventing an asteroid impact.
              <br/>
              Deflecting an asteroid that is on an impact course with Earth requires changing the
              velocity of the object by less than an inch per second years in advance of the predicted impact.
              The two most promising techniques that NASA is investigating are the kinetic impactor
              (hitting an asteroid with an object to slightly slow it down) and the gravity tractor
              (gravitationally tugging on an asteroid by station-keeping a large mass near it)."<br/>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h2>"Would it be possible to shoot down an asteroid that is about to impact Earth?"</h2><br/>
              "An asteroid on a trajectory to impact Earth could not be shot down in the last few minutes or
              even hours before impact.  No known weapon system could stop the mass because of the velocity at
              which it travels – an average of 12 miles per second."<br/>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h2>"Is it likely that an asteroid will impact Earth in the near future?"</h2><br/>
              "Asteroid impacts are a continuously occurring natural process.  Every day, 80 to 100 tons of
              material falls upon Earth from space in the form of dust and small meteorites (fragments of asteroids
              that disintegrate in Earth’s atmosphere).  Over the past 20 years, U.S. government sensors have
              detected nearly 600 very small asteroids a few meters in size that have entered Earth’s atmosphere
              and created spectacular bolides (fireballs).  Experts estimate that an impact of an object the
              size of the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 – approximately 55 feet (17 meters)
              in size – takes place once or twice a century. Impacts of larger objects are expected to be far
              less frequent (on the scale of centuries to millennia).  However, given the current incompleteness
              of the NEO catalogue, an unpredicted impact – such as the Chelyabinsk event – could occur at any time."<br/>
