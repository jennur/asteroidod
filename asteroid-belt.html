    <h1>What is the Asteroid Belt?</h1>
    <div class="belt-content">
      <p>
        When our solar system was just born, dust and rock were orbiting the sun clumping together as a result of
        gravitational forces between the masses. Some gravitational forces became strong enough to form planets, whereas
        a region between Mars and Jupiter remained as what is today known as the asteroid belt.
        <br/>
        <br/>

        <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/small-bodies/asteroids/in-depth/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">NASA claims</a>
        that the total mass of the asteroids in this region is less than the mass of Earth's Moon. Considering the enormous space they
        live in (the <a href="https://theplanets.org/distances-between-planets/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">distance between Mars and Jupiter</a> is
        approximately <a class="tip">3.68 AU <span>550,390,000 km<br /> 342,012,346 miles</span></a>!),
        you can probably (not even) imagine the distance between each of them. Still, it happens quite often that they bump into
        one another and also into planets. Check out the page on <a href="planetary-defense.html">planetary defense</a> if
        you want to know more about how NASA works to defend our own planet from impacts with celestial objects.

        <h3>A mission to the asteroid belt</h3>
      <p>
        September 27, 2007, NASA lauched their mission, <a href="https://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">Dawn</a>
        to the Asteroid belt. In <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/details.php?id=600" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">this video</a> they talk about the mission:

        <h3>Classifications of Asteroids</h3>
        <p>
        One type of classification of asteroids is due to their position in our solar system.
        The majority of the asteroids we know are located in orbit in what we call the Main Asteroid Belt.
        The Main Asteroid Belt is the area between Mars and Jupiter.
        <br/><br/>
        Another group of asteroids is the Trojans. Trojans share orbit with a larger planet where the trojan's position to the planet
        remains stable. This happens because they gather around the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/solarsystem/f-lagrange.html" target="_blank" title="Opens in new tab">Lagrangian points</a> of
        the orbit, where the
        gravitational pull from the two objects maintain the asteroid's position relative to the two objects.
        <br/><br/>
        Near-Earth Asteroids is the last classification group due to asteroid's position,
        and are considered to be asteroids that pass close to Earth.
        <br/><br/>
        Due to asteroids' chemical compositions and reflectivity, there are nine classifications,
        where there are three main groups, namely C-type (Carbon),
        S-type (Silicaceous) and M-type (Metallic). C-type asteroids make up 75% of the asteroid belt, S-type 17%. The remaining
        six groups are rather rare and we call them
        A-, D-, E-, P-, Q- and R-type.
